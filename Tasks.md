Possible tasks:
====

1. Clients of 1188 service can be segmented by frequency of calls (in some period).
  1. We’d like to know if there is some shift in the behavior of different segments in reaction to TV advertisment campaigns. (E.g: if there is more “first-callers”, if low-frequency users started to call more frequently etc.)
2. There is the optimal “time spent” scenario of the call to 1188 service.
  1. We would like to know if there is some patern for specific callcentre operators. If so, how it differs from optimal scenarion. It would help us to improve callcentre efficiency.
3. We would like to know if there are typical calls (type of call, lenght etc.) for different segments, day of weeks or such.
4. There are typical patterns of number of the calls and number of abandoned calls during the day for differnet day of the week.
  1. There are days which are different from these patterns. Some of them we know (hollydays etc.), some of them not. If we realize why are they different we would better plan the occupancy of callcentre.
